<p>Communication is fundamental to human life. We use it every day to get work done, to plan and realize our goals and ambitions, to tell a joke or make someone smile. We use it to form and strengthen relationships, to learn about our friends and loved ones. We even use it to realize ourselves, to explore who we are, and to understand what is important. </p>
<p>
From the day we first begin learning language, everything that we experience, everything we believe, and everything that we are is framed within our our ability to articulate it.
</p>
<p>
In a very real way, we are not capable of having ideas, of learning, of living, without communication.
</p>
<p>
And yet, it is so easy to ignore exactly how we communicate. How we talk to one another. How we write. We are taught these skills early in life but, with everything going on around us, we forget to take the time to improve them.
</p>
<p>
This is a tremendous loss; to each of us as individuals, to all of us as friends, coworkers, neighbors. At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, this is a loss to all of humanity.
</p>
<p>
We believe that communication is a skill that can always be improved; and that improving your communication will enrich every aspect of your life. Further, we believe that taking the time to really think about what others are saying improves not just our ability to share information, but our empathy and ability to relate with one another.
</p>
<p>
We believe that everyone has ideas worth sharing.
</p>
<p>
We believe that learning to better communicate will make the world a better place.
</p>
<p>
If you feel as we do, please join us on this journey. We'll all learn, and we'll all grow together.
